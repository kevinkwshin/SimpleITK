    "1. We use two types of cells, code and markdown.\n",
    "2. To run a code cell, select it (mouse or arrow key so that it is highlighted) and then press shift+enter which also moves focus to the next cell or ctrl+enter which doesn't.\n",

    "```\n",
    "from IPython.core.display import display, HTML\n",
    "display(HTML(\"<style>.container { width:100% !important; }</style>\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or apply this configuration to all notebooks by adding the following to\n",
    "the custom.css jupyter configuration file:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".container { width:100% !important; }\n",
    "```\n",
