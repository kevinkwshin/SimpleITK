    "Resampling as the verb implies is the action of sampling an image, which itself is a sampling of an original continuous signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, resampling in SimpleITK involves four components:\n",
    "1. Image - the image we resample, given in coordinate system $m$.\n",
    "2. Resampling grid - a regular grid of points given in coordinate system $f$ which will be mapped to coordinate system $m$.\n",
    "2. Transformation $T_f^m$ - maps points from coordinate system $f$ to coordinate system $m$, $^mp = T_f^m(^fp)$.\n",
    "3. Interpolator - method for obtaining the intensity values at arbitrary points in coordinate system $m$ from the values of the points defined by the Image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While SimpleITK provides a large number of interpolation methods, the two most commonly used are ```sitkLinear``` and ```sitkNearestNeighbor```. The former is used for most interpolation tasks, a compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. The later is used to interpolate labeled images representing a segmentation, it is the only interpolation approach which will not introduce new labels into the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "SimpleITK's procedural API provides three methods for performing resampling, with the difference being the way you specify the resampling grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```Resample(const Image &image1, Transform transform, InterpolatorEnum interpolator, double defaultPixelValue, PixelIDValueEnum outputPixelType)```\n",
    "2. ```Resample(const Image &image1, const Image &referenceImage, Transform transform, InterpolatorEnum interpolator, double defaultPixelValue, PixelIDValueEnum outputPixelType)```\n",
    "3. ```Resample(const Image &image1, std::vector< uint32_t > size, Transform transform, InterpolatorEnum interpolator, std::vector< double > outputOrigin, std::vector< double > outputSpacing, std::vector< double > outputDirection, double defaultPixelValue, PixelIDValueEnum outputPixelType)```"

    "1. Using wrong settings for the resampling grid, not too common, but does happen.\n",

    "### Defining the Resampling Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above we arbitrarily used the original image grid as the resampling grid. As a result, for many of the transformations the resulting image contained black pixels, pixels which were mapped outside the spatial domain of the original image and a partial view of the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the resulting image to contain all of the original image no matter the transformation, we will need to define the resampling grid using our knowledge of the original image's spatial domain and the **inverse** of the given transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the bounds of the resampling grid when dealing with an affine transformation is straightforward. An affine transformation preserves convexity with extreme points mapped to extreme points. Thus we only need to apply the **inverse** transformation to the corners of the original image to obtain the bounds of the resampling grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the bounds of the resampling grid when dealing with a BSplineTransform or DisplacementFieldTransform is more involved as we are not guaranteed that extreme points are mapped to extreme points. This requires that we apply the **inverse** transformation to all points in the original image to obtain the bounds of the resampling grid.  "
